## **1. Feature Intake & PRD Creation**

### **1.1 Initial Feature Prompt**
> Write a *clear, specific* description of the feature you want to build.
> Example: *"Add a user password reset flow that works via email verification."*

### **1.2 Clarifying Questions (Mandatory AI Step)**
- **AI must pause and ask clarifying questions** to fully define scope, boundaries, and criteria.
- Typical clarifications:
    - What is the exact problem this solves?
    - Who is the end user?
    - What does “done” look like (success criteria)?
    - What are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves?
    - Any related features this interacts with?
    - Data, UI, error handling, edge cases, security, platform notes?
- **User must respond to all**. If user says “you pick,” AI should use best judgment but state assumptions.

### **1.3 PRD Generation**
- AI generates the full PRD *inline* in chat or in the main markdown doc.
    - **PRD Sections:**
        1. Introduction/Overview
        2. Goals (specific, measurable)
        3. User Stories (with “As a…, I want…, so that…”)
        4. Functional Requirements (numbered list)
        5. Non-Goals (out of scope)
        6. Design/UI/UX Considerations (with mockup or description, if relevant)
        7. Technical/Platform Considerations (dependencies, stack notes)
        8. Success Metrics (how will you know it worked)
        9. Open Questions
- **User reviews and approves PRD.** If missing info, user requests revision.
- **PRD markdown files must be named:**
    - `/tasks/YYYYMMDD-HHMM-feature-keyword-prd.md`
    - Example: `/tasks/20251013-1105-password-reset-prd.md`
