## 🚀 Next Steps to Go Live

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

**In Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets:**

```bash
GHL_PRO_PRODUCT_IDS=your_pro_product_ids_here
GHL_TRIAL_PRODUCT_IDS=your_trial_product_ids_here
```

Get product IDs from: GHL Dashboard → Products → Copy Product ID

---

### Step 2: Get Your Webhook URL

```
https://[your-supabase-project].supabase.co/functions/v1/ghl-sync
```

Find your project ref: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → General → Reference ID

---

### Step 3: Create 5 GHL Workflows

Copy the webhook configurations from:
📄 `/docs/GHL_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

**Workflows needed:**
1. Pro Purchase (when user buys)
2. Trial Signup (free signup)
3. Payment Failed (card declined)
4. Payment Recovered (payment success after failure)
5. Cancellation (user cancels)

---

### Step 4: Test Each Workflow

Use the testing guide:
📄 `/docs/GHL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` (Testing section)

**Test checklist:**
- [ ] Pro purchase creates pro user
- [ ] Trial creates free user
- [ ] Payment failure suspends access
- [ ] Payment recovery restores access
- [ ] Cancellation deactivates account
- [ ] Emails are sent
- [ ] Frontend shows correct access

## 📚 Documentation Index

| Document | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `/docs/GHL_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` | 5-min quick start | Setting up workflows |
| `/docs/GHL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` | Complete guide | Full setup & troubleshooting |
| `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | Technical overview | Understanding the system |
| `/supabase/functions/README.md` | Edge functions | Development & debugging |

## 🎯 How It Works

### The Flow

```
1. User purchases in GHL
   ↓
2. GHL workflow sends webhook to your Supabase edge function
   ↓
3. Edge function verifies signature and processes event
   ↓
4. Creates/updates user in database with correct role
   ↓
5. Sends invitation email to user
   ↓
6. User logs in and sees tools based on their role
   ↓
7. Pro users access all tools, free users see locked pro tools
```

### Role System

| User Type | Database Role | Can Access | Status |
|-----------|--------------|------------|---------|
| Free/Trial | `user` | Free tools only | `active = true` |
| Pro Member | `pro` | All tools | `active = true` |
| Admin | `admin` | Everything | `active = true` |
| Failed Payment | Any | Nothing | `active = false` |

---

## 🔧 What Was Built

### Backend (Edge Function)
- ✅ `/supabase/functions/ghl-sync/index.ts`
- Handles all webhook events
- Already deployed and ready

### Database
- ✅ All migrations applied
- ✅ User roles configured
- ✅ Pro tool flags ready
- ✅ RLS policies active

### Frontend
- ✅ `/pages/ToolInterfacePage.tsx` - Pro access validation
- ✅ `/components/ToolCard.tsx` - Visual indicators
- ✅ `/components/ProUpgradeModal.tsx` - Upgrade prompts
- ✅ `/stores/authStore.ts` - Role tracking

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

### Test Pro Purchase Manually:

```bash
# Replace [your-project] with your Supabase project ref
curl -X POST https://[your-project].supabase.co/functions/v1/ghl-sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-wh-signature: test_signature" \
  -d '{
    "event": "pro_purchase",
    "contact": {
      "email": "test-pro@example.com",
      "first_name": "Test",
      "last_name": "User"
    },
    "product": {
      "id": "your_pro_product_id"
    }
  }'
```

**Expected:** Signature will fail (that's good - means function is running!)

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Before Going Live:

1. ✅ Set environment variables in Supabase
2. ✅ Test each GHL workflow with test contacts
3. ✅ Verify webhook signature validation works
4. ✅ Check user creation in database
5. ✅ Test frontend access control
6. ✅ Confirm invitation emails send

### After Going Live:

1. 📊 Monitor edge function logs daily
2. 📧 Verify email deliverability
3. 🔍 Check for webhook failures
4. 👥 Monitor user creation rate
5. 💳 Track payment recovery success

## 🚨 Common Issues (and Solutions)

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Webhook not working | Check URL and x-wh-signature header |
| User not created | Verify email present and product ID matches |
| Role not upgrading | Check GHL_PRO_PRODUCT_IDS variable |
| No invitation email | Check Supabase Auth email settings |
| Frontend access denied | Verify user has correct role in database |

## 📞 Getting Help

### Check Logs First
```
Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → ghl-sync → Logs
```

### Verify Database
```sql
-- Check user exists and has correct role
SELECT u.email, p.role, p.active
FROM auth.users u
JOIN user_profiles p ON u.id = p.id
WHERE u.email = 'user@example.com';
```
