### Step 2: AI Configuration

Configure how the AI processes user inputs.

#### AI Model Selection

**Primary Model**
Choose the main AI model for this tool:
- **Claude (Recommended)**: Better for creative, conversational content
- **GPT-4o-mini**: Faster, more structured responses

**Fallback Model**
Automatically used if primary model is unavailable:
- Ensures reliability
- Configured automatically based on primary choice

#### Custom Prompt Instructions

Provide system-level instructions that guide the AI's behavior.

**What to include**:
- Tone and style guidelines
- Format requirements
- Content structure preferences
- Brand voice characteristics
- Specific do's and don'ts

**Example Prompt Instructions**:
```
You are an expert email copywriter specializing in product launches.
Write in a conversational yet professional tone. Use the AIDA framework
(Attention, Interest, Desire, Action). Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences).
Include a clear call-to-action. Avoid jargon and corporate speak.
```

- **Test and Refine**: Iterate based on real outputs

### Question Design

- **Logical Flow**: Group related questions together
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start broad, get specific
- **Helpful Placeholders**: Show users what kind of answer you want
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't ask the same thing twice

### Knowledge Base

- **Quality Over Quantity**: 5 great examples > 50 mediocre ones
- **Keep Updated**: Refresh files as standards evolve
- **Relevant Content**: Only upload what's specific to this tool
- **Test Without It**: Ensure tool works even if KB isn't used

---

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tool produces inconsistent outputs

**Solution**: Refine your prompt instructions. Be more specific about format, tone, and structure. Add examples to the knowledge base.

---

### Issue: Users skip required questions

**Solution**: Ensure questions are marked as "Required" in the builder. Check that validation is working by testing yourself.

---

### Issue: AI ignores knowledge base files

**Solution**: Verify files uploaded correctly and were processed (check for text extraction). Reference the KB explicitly in prompt instructions: "Use the uploaded brand guidelines to match tone and style."

---

### Issue: Tool takes too long to respond

**Solution**: Consider switching to GPT-4o-mini for faster responses. Reduce knowledge base file sizes. Simplify prompt instructions.
