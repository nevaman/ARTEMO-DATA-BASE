## Tips for Better Results

::: tip Be Specific
The more details you provide in your answers, the better the AI output. Instead of "young people", try "millennials aged 25-35 interested in fitness and wellness."
:::

### Provide Context

Use the knowledge base feature to upload:
- Brand voice examples
- Target audience research
- Product information
- Previous successful content

### Iterate and Refine

3. Regenerate with adjustments
4. Refine manually if needed

### Use Templates

Many tools offer templates or frameworks (AIDA, PAS, etc.). Choose the one that fits your goal.
