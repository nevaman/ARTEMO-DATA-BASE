## 🎨 Brand Integration

### Visual Design
- **Colors**: #008F6B primary (Artemo green), proper dark mode support
- **Typography**: Inter (body), Merriweather (headings) - matches production
- **Components**: Custom quick-start cards, step guides, screenshot placeholders
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first, all breakpoints covered

### Voice & Tone
- **Friendly but Professional**: Conversational without being casual
- **Clear and Concise**: Short sentences, simple language
- **Action-Oriented**: Verb-first, active voice
- **Non-Technical**: Explains jargon, uses analogies

### Example Quality
From Quick Start Guide:
> "Tell Artemo what you want to create. Be specific about your goal. Instead of 'young people', try 'millennials aged 25-35 interested in fitness and wellness.'"
