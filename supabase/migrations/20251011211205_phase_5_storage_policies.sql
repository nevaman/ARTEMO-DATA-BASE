-- Phase 5: Storage Security & Policies
-- Description: This is the final and crucial migration that secures the application's file storage.
--              It creates the "knowledge-base" bucket and applies Row Level Security policies to it,
--              ensuring users can only upload, view, and delete their own files.
-- Idempotency: SAFE - All operations are fully idempotent.

-- matches the first folder name in the path.
