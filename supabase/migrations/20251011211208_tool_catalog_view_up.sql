-- Filename: 20251011211208_tool_catalog_view.sql
-- Description: Creates/updates the tool_catalog view to expose active tools to all
--              authenticated users, including aggregated question data. This version
--              safely handles structural changes by dropping and recreating the view.

BEGIN;

-- To safely handle changes in the view's columns (names, order, or types),
-- the most robust method is to drop the view if it exists and then create it fresh.
-- This is more reliable than attempting complex ALTER VIEW commands.
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.tool_catalog;

-- Create the new, comprehensive view.
-- This acts as a "one-stop-shop" query for the application, combining data from
-- tools, categories, and tool_questions into a single, efficient source.
